## 🎭 Running the Adventure

### Session Zero Considerations
- Set expectations: This is a heist, not a dungeon crawl
- Encourage creative problem-solving
- Stealth and planning are rewarded
- Violence is expensive (literally - Olp dislikes messes)

### DM Tips
- **Reward Creativity:** If players devise a clever plan you didn't anticipate, let it work!
- **Ham Up Olp:** Make him memorable with refined mannerisms and quotable lines
- **Scale Difficulty:** Use the difficulty adjustment guidelines in the DM guide
- **Time Management:** Keep phases moving; don't let planning bog down play
- **Music Matters:** Use the suggested playlist to set the mood

### Scaling Options

**Easier (for inexperienced players or bad luck):**
- Remove 1 hell hound from rooftop
- Shield Guardian has 100 HP instead of 142
- Portal opens at end of Round 2 instead of Round 3
- One pressure plate is already disabled

**Harder (for experienced/optimized parties):**
- Add 2 more veteran guards
- Guardian regenerates faster and has magic resistance
- Vexxus uses Fiendish Charm more aggressively
- Portal takes until Round 4 to stabilize

## 🔮 Campaign Expansion

This one-shot is designed to launch an ongoing campaign!

### Future Job Hooks
1. **The Lich's Phylactery** - Even bigger heist, higher stakes
2. **Vexxus's Revenge** - The cambion tracks them down for payback
3. **Syndicate Rivals** - Competing crime families emerge
4. **Double Cross** - Someone within the Klaws betrays them
5. **The Mammon Job** - The vault owner hires them *against* Olp

### Building the Organization
- Party earns reputation within the Klaws
- Unlocks access to planar black markets
- Gains contacts across multiple planes
- Can recruit their own crew members
- Eventually might challenge Olp for leadership?

### Recurring NPCs
- Gang members become allies, rivals, or mentors
- Vexxus becomes a recurring antagonist or reluctant ally
- Olp provides increasingly dangerous (and lucrative) jobs
- Past heist targets remember the party

## 🛠️ Customization & Modding

### Adapting to Your Setting
- **Sigil/Planescape:** Works perfectly as written
- **Waterdeep:** Change to a noble's estate or auction house
- **Eberron:** Perfect for House Kundarak vault heist
- **Homebrew:** Adjust faction names and planar references

### Alternative Objectives
Instead of stealing the Shard, players could:
- Replace it with a forgery
- Destroy it to prevent someone else from using it
- Rescue a prisoner held in the vault
- Plant evidence to frame someone

### Different Ending
- Party betrays Olp (he's not happy)
- Rival syndicate makes a better offer mid-heist
- The Shard is cursed/sentient and corrupts someone
- Vexxus offers them a job instead

## 🐛 Troubleshooting & FAQ

### "My players bypassed the entire vault!"
**A:** Reward creativity! If they found a clever solution (Dimension Door, Etherealness, etc.), that's great! Move to the escape phase and have Vexxus arrive early because the alarm went off.

### "They killed Vexxus in Phase 1"
**A:** Unlikely but possible. This makes the Twilight Vault very angry with the Klaws. Olp is annoyed but impressed. Replace Vexxus in Phase 3 with an angrier substitute (maybe a pit fiend accountant?).

### "TPK in the vault"
**A:** The Shield Guardian knocks them out, not kills. Guards arrive and arrest them. This becomes a prison break one-shot! Olp is disappointed but offers a redemption job.

### "Players want to join a different syndicate"
**A:** Absolutely! Use the rival syndicate hooks. Maybe they play both sides? Double-agent campaign?

### "They want to recruit the gang members"
**A:** Perfect! That's what the gang member stat blocks are for. Let them build their own crew within the Klaws.
