## FROM THE DESK OF THOKK
*Kobold Klaws - Senior Lieutenant*

You've proven yourselves with the Twilight Vault job. Olp's impressed. So am I.

Now you get the interesting work.

We have a client. Name's Wicket Copperspring. Gnome. Wealthy. Desperate.

Meet him. Hear him out. Job's yours if you want it.

## THE CLIENT'S STORY

### Wicket Copperspring's Request

*[A haggard gnome in expensive black mourning clothes sits before you, fidgeting with a pocket watch. His eyes are red-rimmed, his hands tremble slightly as he speaks.]*

**"Six months ago, my family was murdered."**

*"My wife, Primrose. My daughter, Lily, only eight years old. My son, Jasper, barely six. All three... gone. Killed in their sleep by a professional assassin."*

*"The killer was caught. Her name is Ravens Blackwood. Half-elf. Cold-blooded murderer-for-hire. The city watch has her locked in Iron Scales Prison, maximum security. She's scheduled for execution in two weeks."*

*[He clenches his fists, voice breaking]*

*"But I can't... I can't let the state do it. I need to look her in the eyes. I need her to know what she took from me. My children's laughter. My wife's smile. Everything."*

*"The law has failed me. The courts gave her a quick execution—too easy, too clean. I need personal justice. I need her to face me before the end."*

*[He meets your eyes with desperate intensity]*

**"I'm hiring the Kobold Klaws to break Ravens Blackwood out of Iron Scales Prison and bring her to me."**

**"I'll pay 5,000 gold pieces. Half now, half when you deliver her."**

---

## WHAT YOU'LL NEED

### Recommended Supplies

**For Infiltration:**
- Disguise kit or uniforms

---

## POSSIBLE APPROACHES

### Option 1: The Visitor
Pose as lawyers, clergy, or family members visiting Ravens before her execution. Swap her out during the visit.

**Pros:** Low violence, can scout legitimately
**Cons:** Credentials must be convincing, visiting room is supervised

### Option 2: The Delivery
Infiltrate as supply delivery workers or replacement guards. Navigate to Cell Block D and extract Ravens.

**Pros:** Direct access, can bring tools
**Cons:** Guards know each other, must navigate prison quietly

### Option 3: The Riot
Get arrested, start a prison riot as distraction, break Ravens out during the chaos.

**Pros:** Maximum distraction, overwhelming numbers
**Cons:** Lose equipment, very dangerous, unpredictable

### Option 4: Your Plan
The Kobold Klaws hired you for your creativity. Surprise us.

## WICKET'S PERSONAL NOTE

*[Wicket hands you a small locket. Inside is a portrait of his family—a smiling gnome woman with two small children.]*

**"This was taken a year ago. They were everything to me. Everything."**

**"Ravens Blackwood took them away for money. For a contract. For coin."**

**"I don't expect you to understand what I'm feeling. I don't expect sympathy. I just expect results."**

**"Bring her to me. Let me have justice. That's all I ask."**

---

## QUESTIONS TO CONSIDER

### Planning Session

**Before accepting the job, discuss:**

1. **How will you infiltrate the prison?**
   - Stealth, deception, force, or combination?

2. **How will you navigate to Cell Block D?**
   - Routes through prison, dealing with patrols

3. **How will you free Ravens from her cell?**
   - Lockpicking, breaking bars, stealing keys, magic (outside anti-magic field)?

4. **How will you escape with Ravens?**
   - Boat, bridge, over walls, through tunnels?

5. **What's your backup plan if things go wrong?**
   - Alarm triggers, caught by guards, separated from each other?

6. **How will you transport Ravens to the mill?**
   - Will she cooperate? Need to restrain her? Trust her?

## THOKK'S ADVICE

*[Before you leave, Thokk pulls you aside]*

**"Listen. This job's... unusual. Client's emotional. Target's professional."**

**"Iron Scales is no joke. No one's broken out in forty years. You do this, you're making history."**

**"But here's the thing—once you get her out, job's technically done. What happens at that mill? Between the client and his 'revenge'? Not our business."**

**"We're professionals. We complete contracts. What you do with information you learn along the way... that's your call."**

**"Just remember: we're thieves, not judges. But we're also not mindless tools. Use your heads."**

**"Now go break someone out of an unbreakable prison. Should be interesting."**
