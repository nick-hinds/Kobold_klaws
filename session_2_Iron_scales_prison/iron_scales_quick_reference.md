## COMMON PROBLEMS

**"We can't get past Cell Block D guards"**
→ Distraction, disguise, or wait for patrol

**"Anti-magic field ruins our plan"**
→ That's intentional, use non-magical solutions

**"The chase is too hard"**
→ Reduce DC by 1-2, allow creative solutions

**"Players are paralyzed by moral choice"**
→ Let them debate, no time pressure

**"They want to keep both prisoners"**
→ That's creative! Figure out how
