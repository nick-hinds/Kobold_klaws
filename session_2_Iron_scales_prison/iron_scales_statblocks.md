## NOTES FOR DM

### Moral Complexity Reminders

**Key Points to Convey:**
- Wicket seems genuinely grief-stricken (he's a good actor)
- Ravens is professional, not monstrous (just doing a job)
- The truth shouldn't be obvious until the reveal
- No choice is "wrong" - all have consequences

### Pacing Tips

**Act 1 (Planning):** 30 minutes
- Don't rush the meeting
- Let players plan their approach
- Answer questions about prison security

**Act 2 (Breakout):** 60 minutes
- Keep tension high
- Patrols create urgency
- Don't bog down with too many fights

**Act 3 (Reveal):** 30 minutes
- Give players time to process
- Let them debate in-character
- Don't force quick decision

### Roleplaying the Reveal

**Wicket's Breakdown:**
- Starts defensive
- Becomes angry when accused
- Finally breaks down in self-pity (not remorse)
- Offers more money to fix situation

**Ravens' Honesty:**
- Matter-of-fact about the killing
- No apologies, just facts
- Respects party's professionalism
- Will work with them if it helps her escape
