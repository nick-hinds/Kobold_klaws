# THE IRON SCALES PRISON BREAK
## A Kobold Klaws One-Shot Adventure (Part 2)

*"Revenge is a dish best served cold. But insurance fraud? That's served with interest."*

---

## ADVENTURE OVERVIEW

### Summary
A grief-stricken gnome named **Wicket Copperspring** hires the Kobold Klaws to break his family's murderer out of the infamous **Iron Scales Prison**. He claims he needs to deliver "personal justice" since the law failed him. The party must infiltrate the prison, extract the target, and deliver them to Wicket. 

**The Twist:** Wicket actually hired the assassin to kill his own family for the insurance money. Now he needs to pay the assassin their fee (a large sum he inherited), but can't risk being seen with them. The "revenge" story is a cover. The assassin knows the truth and has been blackmailing Wicket from prison.

### Key Information
- **System:** D&D 5e
- **Players:** 3 characters, level 6
- **Duration:** 2-3 hours
- **Quest Giver:** Thokk (Orc Lieutenant) with Wicket Copperspring (Gnome client)
- **Location:** Iron Scales Prison (military/magical detention facility)
- **Tone:** Heist with moral complexity and a dark twist

---

## OPENING SCENE: THE GILDED WARREN

### Setting the Stage
The party is summoned to the Kobold Klaws hideout for their second job. They're met in the War Room by **Thokk**, the grizzled orc lieutenant, rather than Olp Zix Zap.

**Thokk's Introduction:**
*"Olp's busy with planar business. You proved yourselves with the Twilight Vault job, so you get the interesting work now. We have a client. A paying client. And the job is... unusual."*

### Enter Wicket Copperspring

**Appearance:**
- Male gnome, early 50s, looks haggard and exhausted
- Expensive but rumpled black mourning clothes
- Red-rimmed eyes (from "crying"—actually from lack of sleep and stress)
- Nervous energy, fidgets constantly
- Well-manicured hands (wealthy, doesn't do manual labor)
- Slight tremor when he speaks (guilt? fear? both?)

**His Story (What He Tells the Party):**
*"Six months ago, my family was murdered. My wife, Primrose. My two children, Jasper and Lily. All three... gone."*

*[He pauses, visibly emotional]*

*"The killer was caught. A half-elf woman named **Ravens Blackwood**. Professional assassin. Cold. Efficient. The city watch has her locked in Iron Scales Prison, awaiting execution in two weeks."*

*"But I can't... I can't let the state do it. I need to look her in the eyes. I need her to know what she took from me. I need to deliver justice myself. Personal justice."*

*"I need you to break her out of Iron Scales Prison and bring her to me. I'll pay 5,000 gold pieces. Half now, half when you deliver her."*

**Red Flags (For Perceptive Players):**
- **Insight DC 14:** He's definitely hiding something, but seems genuinely distressed
- **Insight DC 18:** The distress isn't grief—it's fear and guilt
- **Investigation DC 16:** His mourning clothes are expensive but not well-worn (bought recently for show?)
- **Perception DC 15:** He keeps checking a pocket watch nervously (inherited from his wife)
- He never mentions happy memories of his family, only their deaths
- Refers to them formally ("my wife," "my children") not by name except when prompted

**Thokk's Take:**
*"Money's good. Job's unusual but straightforward. Olp approved it. Your call if you want it."*

If the party questions the morality:
*"Not our job to judge. Client pays, we deliver. That's the business."*

## THE TARGET: RAVENS BLACKWOOD

### Basic Information

**Prisoner #4721: Ravens Blackwood**
- Female half-elf, age 34
- Professional assassin (freelance, not guild-affiliated)
- Serving life sentence, execution scheduled in 14 days
- Held in Iron Scales Prison, High Security Wing, Cell Block D
- Known for: Clean kills, never leaving witnesses, expensive rates

### The Truth (Unknown to Party Initially)

Ravens was hired by **Wicket Copperspring** six months ago to kill his own family. The deal:
- **Payment:** 10,000 gp (half up front, half on completion)
- **Target:** Primrose Copperspring and their two children
- **Reason:** Wicket wanted the life insurance payout (50,000 gp) and inheritance (family estate worth 80,000 gp)
- **The Problem:** Ravens was caught due to Wicket's incompetence (he left evidence linking him to her)

**What Went Wrong:**
1. Wicket hired Ravens through an intermediary
2. Ravens completed the job perfectly
3. Wicket was supposed to deliver the second payment (5,000 gp)
4. Instead, Wicket anonymously tipped off the city watch about Ravens
5. Ravens was caught with evidence, but not enough to implicate Wicket
6. Ravens has been blackmailing Wicket from prison (threatening to reveal his involvement)
7. Wicket can't pay her openly without admitting guilt
8. This "prison break revenge plan" is his way to pay her off and make her disappear forever

### Ravens' Personality

**In Prison:**
- Calm, professional, unbothered by incarceration
- Knows she's getting out one way or another
- Has been sending coded messages to Wicket (blackmail)
- Expects either rescue or execution (preferably rescue)

**When Rescued:**
- Immediately professional and cooperative
- Doesn't reveal the truth unless directly asked
- Will work with party to escape
- Plans to disappear after getting paid

**If Confronted:**
- Won't lie, but won't volunteer information
- "I'm a professional. I was hired for a job. I did the job. The rest is between me and my client."
- Will reveal the truth if it helps her escape
- No remorse—it's just business to her

## THE PRISON: IRON SCALES

### Overview

**Iron Scales Prison** is a military-grade magical detention facility run by the City Watch's elite division. It holds the city's most dangerous criminals, political prisoners, and those awaiting execution.

**Location:**
- On an island in the middle of a river (can only be reached by guarded bridge or boat)
- 300 feet from shore on all sides (too far to jump or grapple easily)
- Watchtowers at each corner
- Surrounded by 30-foot walls

**Security Philosophy:**
- Physical barriers (walls, cells, guards)
- Magical wards (anti-magic zones, alarm spells)
- Psychological deterrence (harsh conditions, public executions)

**Reputation:**
- "No one escapes Iron Scales"
- Only three escape attempts in 40 years (all failed)
- The party would be the first successful breakout

### Prison Layout

**Exterior:**
- **The Bridge:** Only authorized entrance, heavily guarded checkpoint
- **The Walls:** 30 feet high, crenellated, patrolled
- **Guard Towers:** Four corners, crossbow nests
- **The Courtyard:** Open area inside walls, used for executions

**Main Building (3 Floors):**

**Ground Floor:**

  - **Ravens' Cell:** D-7, third cell on the left
- **Guard Stations:** At each block entrance

**Third Floor:**
- **Warden's Quarters:** Private rooms
- **Officer's Mess:** Higher-rank dining
- **The Chapel:** For final prayers before execution
- **The Observatory:** Guard command center, magical scrying

**Basement:**
- **The Oubliette:** Solitary confinement (the hole)
- **The Vaults:** Evidence lockup, prisoner belongings
- **Maintenance:** Plumbing, magical infrastructure
- **Secret Tunnel:** Unknown to most, connects to old smuggling route (collapsed, but could be cleared)

### Security Measures

**Physical Security:**
- Guards patrol every 20 minutes
- All cells are locked (DC 18 to pick)
- Cell bars are reinforced steel (AC 19, HP 50 each)
- Doors are thick oak with iron bands (AC 17, HP 60)

**Magical Security:**
- **Anti-Magic Field** in Cell Block D (no spells work)
- **Alarm Wards** on all exterior doors and windows
- **Scrying Sensors** in common areas (Observatory monitors)
- **Silence Spell** on interrogation rooms (permanent)

**Personnel:**
- **50 guards total** (20 on duty at any time, 10 per 12-hour shift)

- **Mage-Captain Elara Voss** (war wizard, handles magical threats)
- **4 Veteran Guards** (elite, personal warden's guard)

---

## THE PLAN: THREE APPROACHES

Like the Twilight Vault heist, the party can choose their approach.

### Approach 1: THE VISITOR (Social/Deception)

**Concept:** Pose as lawyers, clergy, or family visiting Ravens before her execution.

**Steps:**
1. Forge documents (lawyer credentials or clergy papers)
2. Schedule a visit (Persuasion/Deception to convince guards)
3. Meet Ravens in visitor's room
4. Swap her with a disguised party member or use invisibility
5. Walk out with Ravens disguised as a party member

**Challenges:**
- Guards verify visitor credentials (Deception DC 15)
- Visitor's room is supervised (Stealth DC 16 to swap)
- Anti-magic field prevents illusion spells in cells
- Must leave "someone" behind (illusion, simulacrum, or sacrifice a disguise)

**Advantages:**
- Least violent approach
- Can scout the prison legitimately
- Low alarm risk if done well

### Approach 2: THE DELIVERY (Infiltration/Stealth)

**Concept:** Sneak in via supply delivery or as new guards.

**Steps:**
1. Intercept a supply boat or guard shift change
2. Disguise as delivery workers or replacement guards
3. Navigate through prison to Cell Block D
4. Break Ravens out of her cell
5. Escape via boat or through maintenance tunnels

**Challenges:**
- Guards know each other (Deception DC 17 to impersonate)
- Anti-magic field in Cell Block D (can't use magic there)
- Patrols are regular (Stealth checks every 10 minutes)
- Cell locks are difficult (Thieves' Tools DC 18)

**Advantages:**
- More direct access to cells
- Can bring tools/weapons hidden in supplies
- Boat escape route available

### Approach 3: THE RIOT (Combat/Chaos)

**Concept:** Create a prison riot as distraction, extract Ravens in the chaos.

**Steps:**
1. Get arrested on purpose (minor crime, get thrown in Block B or C)
2. Make contact with other prisoners (Persuasion to start riot)
3. Cause riot during meal time (prisoners outnumber guards 3:1)
4. Use chaos to reach Cell Block D
5. Break out Ravens and escape in confusion

**Challenges:**
- Getting arrested means losing equipment (stored in Vaults)
- Riot is dangerous (combat with prisoners AND guards)
- Anti-magic field still active in Block D
- Warden will lock down prison fast (3 rounds after riot starts)

**Advantages:**
- Maximum chaos, maximum distraction
- Other prisoners create cover
- Guards spread thin dealing with riot
- Could recruit prisoners to help (temporary allies)

---

## PHASE-BY-PHASE BREAKDOWN

### PHASE 1: INFILTRATION (30-45 minutes)

**Goal:** Get inside Iron Scales Prison

**Key Locations:**
- **The Bridge:** Main checkpoint (2 guards, credential check)
- **The Docks:** Supply entrance (1 guard, less scrutinized)
- **The Walls:** Climbable but exposed (Watchtower guards, Perception +5)

**Obstacles:**
- Credential verification (Deception/Forgery)
- Searched for weapons (Sleight of Hand DC 14 to hide small items)
- Guard recognition (if impersonating guards)
- Magical detection (Arcane Lock on main entrance, Alarm on dock entrance)

**NPCs:**
- **Guard Captain Hendricks:** Checkpoint commander, suspicious by nature
- **Delivery Worker Marta:** Regular supply boat driver, can be bribed (100 gp)
- **Guard Rookie Finn:** New guard, nervous, easier to fool

**Possible Complications:**
- Guard shift change happens during infiltration (more eyes)
- Unexpected inspection (Warden walking through)
- Another visitor shows up (rival lawyer? actual family member?)

### PHASE 2: EXTRACTION (45-60 minutes)

**Goal:** Reach Cell Block D and free Ravens

**The Journey Through Prison:**

**Ground Floor Navigation:**
- Guards at every junction (Stealth DC 13-15)
- Officer questioning presence (Deception DC 14-16)
- Locked doors (Thieves' Tools DC 15 or proper keys)

**Reaching Cell Block D:**
- Must climb stairs to 2nd floor
- Guard station at Block D entrance (2 guards, always vigilant)
- Anti-magic field begins 20 feet from entrance
- Alarm ward on Block D door (DC 18 Arcana to disable)

**Ravens' Cell (D-7):**
- Third cell on left in maximum security wing
- Steel bars, locked door
- Ravens is inside, sitting calmly on her bunk
- She recognizes professionals when she sees them

**Ravens' Reaction:**
*"Took him long enough. Let me guess—he told you I killed his family, and he wants revenge? That man couldn't tell the truth if it would save his life. Get me out of here, and I'll tell you the real story."*

**Options for Freeing Her:**
- Pick the lock (DC 18, 1 minute, can be heard)
- Steal keys from guard (Stealth/Combat)
- Break bars (Strength DC 22, loud, takes 2 rounds)
- Magic (won't work due to anti-magic field)
- Convince guards to open cell (very difficult, DC 20 Deception/Persuasion)

**Possible Complications:**
- Guard patrol arrives (random encounter, 1d6: 1-2 = patrol)
- Another prisoner recognizes party (shouts for help or demands to be freed)
- Ravens has information that changes the party's perspective
- Alarm is triggered (accidentally or intentionally)

### PHASE 3: ESCAPE (45-60 minutes)

**Goal:** Get out of Iron Scales with Ravens

**Alarm Status:**
- **No Alarm:** Can attempt stealthy exit the way they came
- **Alarm Triggered:** Full lockdown, all guards mobilized, must find alternative

**Escape Routes:**

**Route 1: The Way You Came**
- Retrace steps to entrance
- More guards present (increased patrols)
- Must talk or sneak past

**Route 2: The Docks**
- Steal a supply boat
- Navigate to shore (river is swift, DC 12 to control boat)
- Guards may give chase in second boat

**Route 3: Over the Walls**
- Requires climbing gear or magic
- Watchtowers will shoot (crossbow attacks)
- 30-foot drop to water on other side (or 300-foot swim)

**Route 4: The Secret Tunnel (If Discovered)**
- Basement maintenance area
- Collapsed old smuggling tunnel
- Requires clearing rubble (Strength checks, 10 minutes)
- Comes out in abandoned warehouse on mainland

**Route 5: The Riot Exit (If Riot Approach)**
- Chaos provides cover
- Main gate might be breached by rioters
- Could escape in the confusion

**Chase Sequence (If Detected):**

Similar to Twilight Vault rooftop, but through prison:
- **Skill Challenge:** 6 successes before 3 failures
- **Available Skills:**
  - Athletics (climb, jump, push through)
  - Acrobatics (dodge, slide, parkour)
  - Stealth (hide, lose pursuers)
  - Deception (blend in, false directions)
  - Intimidation (threaten guards, scare prisoners)
  - Sleight of Hand (throw obstacles behind you)

**Pursuers:**
- 4 Veteran Guards (led by Warden Grimstone)
- Mage-Captain Elara Voss (flying, casting spells)
- 2 Guard Dogs (tracking, fast)

**Final Confrontation (If Caught):**

If the party is cornered or chooses to fight:

**Location:** The Courtyard (execution ground)

**Enemies:**
- Warden Grimstone (tough fighter, tactical)
- Mage-Captain Elara Voss (war wizard, battlefield control)
- 4 Veteran Guards (disciplined, coordinated)
- Potentially reinforcements if battle drags on

**Environmental Factors:**
- Gallows in center (can be used for cover or traps)
- Watchtowers provide high ground for guards
- Execution bell (if rung, more guards arrive)
- Gates can be barred (DC 20 Strength to force open)

**Victory Conditions:**
- Defeat enough enemies to escape
- Escape through a breached gate
- Negotiate surrender (and hope for rescue later)
- Thokk sends backup if party signals for help (costs favor)

---

## THE HANDOFF: THE TWIST REVEALED

### The Meeting Location

Wicket arranges to meet the party at an abandoned mill outside the city, 2 hours after the breakout.

**The Setting:**
- Old stone mill by a river
- Isolated, no witnesses
- Moon is full (good visibility)
- Ravens is in bonds (or pretending to be)
- Wicket arrives with a large chest (the "payment")

### Wicket's Arrival

**His Demeanor:**
- Nervous, sweating despite cool night
- Keeps glancing at Ravens
- Has a loaded crossbow (poorly hidden)
- The chest is real (contains 5,000 gp as promised)

**What He Says:**
*"You did it. You actually did it. I... I didn't think anyone could break someone out of Iron Scales."*

*[He approaches Ravens carefully]*

*"Hello, Ravens. Remember me?"*

### Ravens' Response

**If Still Bound:**
*"Of course I remember you, Wicket. You hired me. You paid me. And then you tried to have me executed. Not very professional."*

**If Free:**
*"We need to talk, Wicket. About what you owe me. And these fine people deserve to know the truth about who they're working for."*

### The Truth Comes Out

Ravens explains (if party lets her speak):

1. Wicket hired her to kill his family six months ago
2. He wanted the insurance money and inheritance
3. She completed the job as contracted
4. He never paid the second half (5,000 gp)
5. He tipped off the watch to have her arrested
6. She's been blackmailing him from prison
7. This "breakout" was his way to pay her without witnesses

**Evidence:**
- Ravens has receipts (coded, but decipherable)
- She knows details about the family only Wicket would know
- The payment amount is exactly what he owes her (not revenge money)
- Wicket's reaction confirms it (he doesn't deny effectively)

### Wicket's Breakdown

**If Confronted:**
*"I... I didn't have a choice! They were going to leave me. Primrose was leaving me, taking the children, taking half of everything! I couldn't... I couldn't let that happen. The business, the estate, it's my family's legacy, not hers! I did what I had to do!"*

He's not sorry about the murders—he's sorry he got caught.

### The Party's Choice

Now the party must decide:

**Option 1: Complete the Job**
- Let Ravens take the payment
- Walk away (not their problem)
- Keep their half of the payment from Wicket (2,500 gp from earlier)
- Ravens disappears, Wicket gets away with murder

**Option 2: Turn Them Both In**
- Report to the city watch
- Ravens goes back to prison (or gets executed)
- Wicket gets arrested for conspiracy to murder
- Party gets no payment, makes enemy of Kobold Klaws (maybe)
- But justice is served

**Option 3: Kill Wicket**
- "Deliver justice" themselves
- Take the 5,000 gp chest
- Ravens gets paid and escapes
- Party keeps Wicket's payment too (7,500 gp total)
- Morally gray but profitable

**Option 4: Kill Ravens**
- Wicket offers additional 5,000 gp to finish her
- Eliminates his blackmailer
- Party becomes accomplices to murder
- Very profitable (7,500 + 5,000 = 12,500 gp)
- Very dark choice

**Option 5: Kill Them Both**
- Take all the money (10,000 gp + whatever they can loot)
- No witnesses, no problems
- Extremely profitable
- Extremely evil

**Option 6: Creative Solution**
- Fake Ravens' death, let her escape
- Force Wicket to pay ongoing "silence fee"
- Blackmail Wicket for more later
- Turn Ravens into an asset for Kobold Klaws

### Thokk's Guidance (If Called)

If party contacts Thokk via sending stone:

*"Client paid, job's done. What you do now is your business. Just remember—we're professionals, not heroes. But we're not monsters either. Your call."*

Thokk won't judge, but will respect whatever choice shows intelligence and principles.

---

## AFTERMATH & CONSEQUENCES

### If Ravens Lives

She thanks the party and offers:
- **Contact Information:** She's available for future assassin work (expensive but reliable)
- **Debt Owed:** She owes the party a favor (one free job or critical information)
- **Professional Respect:** Will speak well of them in criminal underworld

She disappears into the night, heading for another plane where she can work freely.

### If Ravens Dies

- Wicket is relieved but paranoid
- No blackmailer, but party knows his secret
- He may try to eliminate the party later (hiring another assassin)
- Or he pays them hush money regularly

### If Wicket Lives

- He returns to his life, inherits the estate
- Becomes a wealthy, guilt-ridden recluse
- Potential future client (or target) for Kobold Klaws
- May confess on his deathbed (years later)

### If Wicket Dies

- His estate goes to distant relatives
- Investigation into his death (cursory, no evidence)
- Ravens' blackmail material becomes valuable (or dangerous)
- City watch might link his death to prison break

### Kobold Klaws Reaction

**Olp's Response** (when party returns):

*"I heard about Iron Scales. Impressive. First successful breakout in forty years. The Klaws' reputation just improved considerably."*

*"As for the client situation... [he swirls his wine] ...I'm sure you handled it appropriately. We don't ask too many questions about what happens after delivery. Plausible deniability and all that."*

*"Here's your payment. And here's something extra—a bonus for handling a complicated situation with discretion."*

**Payment:**
- Base pay: 2,500 gp from Wicket (initial half)
- Bonus from Olp: 1,000 gp (for successful prison break)
- Whatever they took from the meeting (varies by choice)

**Reputation Gain:**
- +2 to Kobold Klaws standing (unlocks better jobs)
- Nickname: "The Iron Breakers"
- Other criminals seek them out for jail breaks

## MORAL COMPLEXITY & PLAYER AGENCY

### The Key Tension

Unlike the first heist (Twilight Vault), this adventure forces players to confront moral ambiguity:

**Questions to Consider:**
- Is helping a murderer escape justice wrong if you didn't know?
- When you learn the truth, what's your responsibility?
- Is Ravens more or less guilty than Wicket?
- Does completing a contract matter more than doing what's right?
- What does "professional criminal" mean when innocents are involved?

### No Wrong Answer

The adventure is designed so that any choice the party makes is valid:

- **Complete the job:** Professional, detached, not their problem
- **Turn them in:** Heroic, principled, costly
- **Kill one or both:** Pragmatic, dark, profitable
- **Creative solution:** Clever, complex, memorable

**Olp's philosophy applies here:**
*"We're thieves, not judges. But we're also not mindless tools. Use your heads. Use your conscience if you have one. Either way, use discretion."*

### Thokk's Role

Thokk is the perfect quest-giver for this because:
- He's experienced (seen it all before)
- He's pragmatic (doesn't judge)
- He's honorable (in his own way)
- He trusts the party to make the right call for themselves

**His advice afterward:**
*"You did what you thought was right. That's all any of us can do. The Klaws isn't about being good or evil—it's about being smart and having a code. Sounds like you've got both."*

- Let them debate in-character
- Respect whatever they choose

### If Players Get Stuck

**In Prison:**

## CONCLUSION

**The Iron Scales Prison Break** is more than a jailbreak—it's a test of the party's moral compass and professional ethics. It asks: *When you learn you're working for the villain, what do you do?*

There's no right answer. Only consequences.

Welcome back to the Kobold Klaws, where every job has a twist, and nothing is as simple as it seems.

*"In our line of work, clean hands are a luxury. Professionals just make sure the dirt comes off at the end of the day."*
— Thokk, Orc Lieutenant
