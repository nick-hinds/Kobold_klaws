## RULES OF ENGAGEMENT

1. **Discretion is valuable.** The less attention you draw, the better.

2. **Violence is expensive.** Bodies require cleanup, and cleanup is costly. Avoid unnecessary casualties.

3. **Failure is... disappointing.** I appreciate effort, but results matter more.

4. **The Shard must be intact.** Damaged goods are worthless goods.

5. **You have one sending stone.** Use it wisely. I may have... adjustments to the plan.

---

## EMERGENCY PROTOCOLS

**If Discovered:**
- Make your way to the rooftop
- I will arrange an emergency extraction point
- Do NOT attempt to flee through main entrance (too many witnesses)

**If Separated:**
- Regroup at the kitchen service entrance
- If that's compromised, rooftop is the fallback

**If Captured:**
- Kobold Klaws does not exist (officially)
- You're freelancers with a gambling debt
- I will... arrange alternatives, but don't expect me to storm the castle

---

## FINAL THOUGHTS

This is your audition. Show me you're clever, capable, and cool under pressure. The Kobold Klaws values professionals who can think on their feet and adapt to changing circumstances.

Style matters. Anyone can bash down a door. It takes true artistry to walk through it without anyone noticing.

The Twilight Vault has never been successfully robbed. Make history tonight.

Do try not to die. Good help is so hard to find.

Best of luck,

**Olp Zix Zap**
*Proprietor, Kobold Klaws Interplanar Syndicate*

## MEETING LOCATION

**When:** Tonight, 5:45 PM
**Where:** The abandoned warehouse on Sigil's Clerk Ward (or local planar hub)
**What to bring:** Your skills, your wits, and an appetite for adventure

The uniforms will be waiting for you.
