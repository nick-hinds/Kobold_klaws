## COMMON PLAYER TRICKS

**"Can we use Disguise Self?"** - Yes! Makes Phase 1 easier.

**"I cast Invisibility and grab it."** - Smart! But force field still needs disabled.

**"We kill all the guards."** - Possible but alerts everyone. Stealth fails.

**"Can we negotiate with Vexxus?"** - He's professional. Might accept bribe but it'd be EXPENSIVE.

**"What if we destroy the Shard?"** - Olp is NOT happy. No payment.

## MUSIC PLAYLIST SUGGESTIONS

🎵 **Auction Floor:** Jazz, sophisticated ambiance
🎵 **Vault Infiltration:** Mission Impossible theme, tense spy music  
🎵 **Combat:** Epic battle themes
🎵 **Rooftop:** High-stakes action music
🎵 **Escape:** Triumphant heist finale

---

## IF THINGS GO WRONG

**Caught in Phase 1:** Chase scene, still can reach vault if sneaky

**TPK in Phase 2:** Guardian restrains, guards arrest (escape later?)

**Failed entirely:** Olp disappointed, offers redemption job

**Party goes murder-hobo:** Vexxus calls SWAT team equivalent, overwhelming force

---

## FUTURE HOOKS

1. The Lich's Phylactery heist
2. Vexxus seeks revenge
3. Rival crime syndicate appears
4. Mammon's Grip (vault owner) has plans
5. Internal Klaws betrayal

---

This is a **HEIST**, not a dungeon crawl!
- Reward creativity and planning
- Stealth > Combat
- Style points matter
- Have fun with Olp's personality
- Ocean's Eleven meets D&D

**Party goal:** Get in, get Shard, get out
**Your goal:** Make them feel like badass thieves

Good luck, and welcome them to the Kobold Klaws! 🎩🐉✨
