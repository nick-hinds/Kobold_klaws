# THE KOBOLD KLAWS HIDEOUT
## *"The Gilded Warren"*

---

## Location & Exterior

### The Warehouse District Cover
The Kobold Klaws headquarters is hidden in plain sight within an abandoned warehouse in Sigil's Clerk Ward (or any planar hub city's industrial district). From the outside, it appears to be just another forgotten building among dozens of similar structures—crumbling brick walls covered in old shipping company logos, boarded-up windows, and a rusted "CONDEMNED" sign that discourages casual investigation.

**Exterior Details:**
- Faded paint: "PLANAR IMPORTS & EXPORTS - Est. 1372"
- Rusty loading dock with broken chains
- Graffiti from local gangs (who wisely avoid the place)
- Single door with seven different locks (only one actually works)
- Subtle wards against divination magic (DC 18 Arcana to detect)
- Gargoyle watchers on the roof (look like weathered stone, actually constructs)

### The Real Entrance
The main door is a decoy. Regular members enter through:
- **Option 1:** A sewer grate three buildings over that leads to underground tunnels
- **Option 2:** A planar portal in an adjacent alley (requires Kobold Klaw pin to activate)
- **Option 3:** A "delivery entrance" that only opens to a specific knock sequence
- **Option 4:** For emergencies, a Dimension Door anchor point on the roof

## In Conclusion

The Gilded Warren is more than a hideout—it's a home, a fortress, and a statement. Olp Zix Zap has built something special here: a place where criminals can be professionals, where loyalty matters more than gold, and where style is just as important as substance.

It's the kind of place where you could get killed for betrayal, but you'd do it over expensive wine in comfortable chairs.

*Welcome to the family.*
