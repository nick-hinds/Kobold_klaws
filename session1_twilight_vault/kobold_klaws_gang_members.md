## USING GANG MEMBERS IN YOUR CAMPAIGN

### As Backup/Reinforcements

*"The quiet one is Shade"* (the Wererat, currently grooming whiskers) *"Best scout in five planes."*

*"Our mercenary friend you know as Bargain"* (the Yugoloth) *"Expensive but worth every copper."*

*"Grunk here"* (pats the Bugbear's arm) *"looks scary but he's a sweetheart. Mostly."*

*"And this old war dog is Thokk"* (the Orc nods) *"He's been in the business longer than I've been alive. Which is saying something for a kobold."*
