### Tactical Considerations

- **Escape:** Portal opens end of Round 3, dive through!

**For DM:**
- Vexxus should feel threatening but not impossible
- If party is struggling, have Vexxus focus on taunting/monologuing
- If party is dominating, have more guards climb up
- Hell Hounds should use Fire Breath to control space
- Vexxus retreats at 25 HP: "You'll regret this!"

## SESSION CHECKLIST

### Before Game:

- [ ] Set grid to 70 pixels per square
- [ ] Place tokens for NPCs and monsters
- [ ] Set up dynamic lighting (optional)
- [ ] Print/have stat blocks ready
- [ ] Review pressure plate locations
- [ ] Prepare Olp's voice/personality

### Player Handouts:
- [ ] Twilight Vault floor plan (incomplete)
- [ ] Disguises (waiter uniforms)
- [ ] Bag of holding
- [ ] Sending stone
- [ ] Invitation (fake) if needed

### Key NPCs to Prep:
- [ ] Olp Zix Zap - Crime boss, mission giver
- [ ] Vexxus - Main antagonist, tactical
- [ ] Kaz - Drunk fire genasi, info source
- [ ] Shield Guardian - Optional combat
- [ ] Auction Guests - Background flavor

### Music Suggestions:
- **Auction floor:** Sophisticated jazz, ambient
- **Vault infiltration:** Tense, spy thriller music
- **Pressure plates triggered:** Action combat music
- **Rooftop finale:** Epic battle theme
- **Victory/Escape:** Triumphant heist music

### Pacing Tips:
- **Phase 1:** 30-45 min (roleplay heavy)
- **Phase 2:** 45-60 min (puzzles & tension)
- **Phase 3:** 45-60 min (action climax)
- **Total:** 2-3 hours

### Common Player Questions:

**Q: Can we case the place beforehand?**
A: Not really—auction is tonight only. But Olp gives them basic floor plan.

**Q: What if we kill Vexxus?**
A: Technically possible, but he retreats at low HP. Killing him makes Kobold Klaws enemies with Twilight Vault (future complications!).

**Q: Can we steal other items?**
A: Sure! But each extra item increases security response. Risk vs reward.

**Q: What if we fail completely?**
A: Olp is disappointed but appreciates the attempt. Offers one more chance at easier job. Not joining Klaws yet.

## POST-SESSION HOOKS

### If Successful:
- Party now has Kobold Klaws connections
- Access to planar black markets
- Olp contacts them for bigger heists
- Twilight Vault puts bounty on them (subtle)
- Mammon's Grip (vault owner) remembers them

### If Failed but Survived:
- Olp offers redemption job
- Must lay low for a while
- Vexxus remembers their faces
- Can retry later with better intel

### Future Adventure Hooks:
1. **The Lich's Phylactery:** Next big heist, higher stakes
2. **Vexxus's Revenge:** He tracks them down for payback
3. **Syndicate Rivals:** Competing crime families emerge
4. **Double Cross:** Someone in the Klaws betrays them
5. **The Mammon Job:** Vault owner hires them against Olp

---

## TROUBLESHOOTING

**Problem:** Party gets caught in Phase 1
**Solution:** Social encounter, chase back to kitchen, alarm raised early

**Problem:** Party can't solve arcane door
**Solution:** Kaz drunkenly mentions seeing "Vexxus type something"

**Problem:** TPK possible in Phase 2
**Solution:** Guardian just restrains them, guards arrive, arrested not killed

**Problem:** Rooftop too easy/hard
**Solution:** Adjust waves, have Vexxus flee earlier/later

**Problem:** Party tries completely different approach
**Solution:** Reward creativity! Olp loves style. Adjust as needed.

---

## FINAL NOTES

This is a **heist one-shot** - it's meant to be fun, fast-paced, and stylish. Don't sweat perfect balance. If players come up with a clever plan you didn't anticipate, let them try it! The goal is Ocean's Eleven meets D&D, not Dark Souls difficulty.

Olp Zix Zap should become a memorable NPC. Ham it up! Make him quotable.

Remember: The Kobold Klaws are *professional criminals*, not murder hobos. Stealth and style over combat.

Have fun, and welcome to the Kobold Klaws! 🎩🐉
